# Assignment1

1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?
  It was shorter and easier to implement the "csvtojson" module in order to create the array, i had difficulties turning the Json object to a string and to create a file i used the code 
  2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? 
  i ran the file with the 'node' command so if it created the json file and it was arranged as i expected i knew it had worked
  3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewer will know ahead of time
  everything wrong was my doing.
